**Making images for palaeontological figures in Blender**
This is an introduction to using Blender for making images of 3D models which can be used for scientific figures.
It is aimed at someone with no experience of Blender, and intended as a general sweep of particularly useful features for palaeontologists. 
It will cover basic controls, importing your models, scene setup, lighting, materials, and rendering.
This was originally written for a workshop I did in the MNHN, using Blender 2.8.

**What is Blender and why use it?**
Blender is a free, open source software for 3D computer graphics ([website](https://www.blender.org/)).
In this tutorial we will be using it to set up a very simple "virtual studio" to image 3D models of fossils.
However Blender can do almost anything you'd want to do with 3D data - sculpting, modelling, rigging, animations, video editing, compositing...
Because it is free it is also very widely used and there are loads of videos and guides on the internet.
Blender gives you far more control over images of 3D models than the built in 3D viewers in (for example) Mimics.
This means you can produce images which are not only more beautiful, but which are also better at illustrating anatomy.

**Installing Blender**
You will find Blender to download [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).
It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and doesn't require a particularly powerful machine to run.
However, its speed/crashiness will scale with how good your computer (particularly GPU I think) is.
Because it is under constant development Blender is constantly being updated with new features, so it can be worth keeping an eye on releases.

**The Canvas**
Like all (?) illustration programs Inkscape works on a canvas, which can be manipulated
* *Changing size* This is done in the Properties tab
