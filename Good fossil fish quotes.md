**This is a selection of amusing and/or wise quotes I have collected from the literature**


* "It must be a cause of some surprise that these apparently inoffensive fish should be capable of arousing such passions." **Halstead (1973)** *on heterostracans*
* "On one small slab, less than 8 inches square, in my possession, covered with scales and other remains of the larger Euthacanthus, upwards of two dozen may be counted, attracted evidently by the dead Fish, only to be silted up and entombed with the Euthacanthus on which they feasted." **Powrie (1864)** *on Turin Hill Acanthodes [Mesacanthus mitchelli]*
* "The Agnatha did not spring forth, like Pallas Athene, fully armed upon an unsuspecting world" **White (1946)** *on the evolution of body armour in gnathostomes*
* "This study has produced no compelling new evidence on the relationships of acanthodians, but it has clarified a number of points." **Miles 1970** *on acanthodian axial skeletons*
* "In developing their special jaw-elements the acanthodians had, in other words, entered an evolutionary cul-de-sac of no return" **Orvig (1973)** *on ischnacanthid jaw elements* 
* "REIS, JAEKEL and BASHFORD DEAN are in agreement that there is another element in the hyoid arch which would represent a pharyngo-hyal and lie dorsally to the epi-hyal. None of the materials at my disposal show a trace of such a bone and some of these are so well preserved and satisfactorily displayed as to make me doubtful of its actual existence, although in face of the concensus of opinion of the authors I have mentioned I should be very sorry to deny its presence." **Watson (1937)** *on pharyngohyals in Acanthodes*
* 	"Hammers an' chisels an' a', Chisels an' fossils an' a'; Resurrections our trade, by raising the dead We've grandeur and honour an' a'; It's good to be breaking a stone, The work now is lucky and braw; It's grand to be finding a bone - A fish-bone the grandest of a'." Robert Dick
