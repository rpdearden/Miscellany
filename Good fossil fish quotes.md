**This is a selection of amusing and/or wise quotes I have collected from the literature**


* "It must be a cause of some surprise that these apparently inoffensive fish should be capable of arousing such passions." **Halstead (1973)** *on heterostracans*
* "On one small slab, less than 8 inches square, in my possession, covered with scales and other remains of the larger Euthacanthus, upwards of two dozen may be counted, attracted evidently by the dead Fish, only to be silted up and entombed with the Euthacanthus on which they feasted." **Powrie (1864)** *on Turin Hill Acanthodes [Mesacanthus mitchelli]*
* "The Agnatha did not spring forth, like Pallas Athene, fully armed upon an unsuspecting world" **White (1946)** *on the evolution of body armour in gnathostomes*
* "This study has produced no compelling new evidence on the relationships of acanthodians, but it has clarified a number of points." **Miles 1970** *on acanthodian axial skeletons*
