**Introduction to Inkscape**
This is an introduction to the free vector software Inkscape, originally written for the [Silwood Park](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/) Computer Skillz workshop.
It is not intended to be even slightly comprehensive, but is instead an introduction to what I use the software for (such as making figures for scientific publication, or posters).
The same mad skillz could however equally well applied to making other graphics, such as stag-do t-shirts or dank memes.
Inkscape is very well documented online, both by Inkscape themselves [here](https://inkscape.org/en/learn/) and by wise sages advising clueless idiots like me on forums like Stack Exchange, which can best be found [here](http://www.lmfgtfy.com/).
Pros of Inkscape are that it is free and basically does what expensive programs like Illustrator do, and that it is a Vector program, so can deal with vector graphics (see [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/dida/graphics/bitmapvectorrev3.shtml) for an explanation of what that means).
Cons include that it can be a bit clunky, particularly on Macs where you have to run it via XQuartz which allows cross-platform programs to run on mac (note that for hotkeys this means that you use ctrl like on windows, rather than cmd like on most mac programs).

**The Canvas**
Like all (?) illustration programs Inkscape works on a canvas, which can be manipulated
* *Changing size* This is done in the Properties tab
![Properties](https://github.com/rpdearden/Miscellany/blob/master/How-to/Images/Ink_Properties.png "Document properties")

**Importing/manipulating objects**
Objects can be imported and manipulated in Inkscape - I use this to make posters and figures.
* *Open images* Various kinds of image can be opened in Inkscape, both vector and bitmap format.
* *Import images* You can also import images into Inkscape
![Opening](https://github.com/rpdearden/Miscellany/blob/master/How-to/Images/Ink_Opening.png "Opening stuff")


* *Shapes* A number of shapes are createable in Inkscape - polygons, circles, and squares
* *Text* You can create regions of text
![Objects](https://github.com/rpdearden/Miscellany/blob/master/How-to/Images/Ink_Objects.png "Object options")

* *Colouring objects* The colour of both the stroke (line) and fill (inside) of objects can be manipulated, either by choosing a colour, by hexcode, or by using the pipette. Can also do gradients
* *Manipulating objects* Objects can be manipulated by the handles.  Left click twice to get rotatey handles, and hold ctrl to scale isometrically.
* *Grouping* Group objects to get them to move and behave together - select multiple objects by shift-left clicking
* *Layers* You can assign objects to different layers using the layers menu - you can move layers up and down and hide them. 
* *Guides*  Guides can be dragged from the rulers at the top and sides - objects will snap to them so they're useful for organising stuff. rotte them by holding shift, or shift-ctrl for 15 degree rotations.  Get rid of them by dragging them to a ruler or going to edit-delete all guides
* *Other tools* There are various other tools you should have a play with, such as 3D boxes and spray

**Drawing in Inkscape**
Drawing can be useful for simplifying bitmap images, or for redrawing parts of larger illustrations (or just for drawing).
* *Freehand drawing* Freehand drawing does what it says on the tin - note if you finish a line early you can join to the nodes at the end.  There are various settings at the top.
* *Bezier curves* Bezier curves are useful for drawing - they consist of lines linking nodes.  Lines can be either left straight, or curved by either dragging or by manipulating the handles.
* *Calligraphy* I haven't used this much, but you can also do calligraphic drawing.
![Drawing](https://github.com/rpdearden/Miscellany/blob/master/How-to/Images/Ink_Drawing.png "Drawing options")
* *Joining up dem lines* If you join up the lines by their end nodes you create an object- this can then be filled.  This is useful for drawing irregular shapes.

**Converting bitmap graphics into vector graphics** 
If you're too lazy to draw there is another path if you have a bitmap image that you need to turn in to a vector  - this is useful if you have to scale it up and don't want to lose resolution, or for images that need to be submitted in vector format (eg. t-shirt prints).
It works well for basic images, such as those formed by a series of lines, and badly for those that are complicated .
Inkscape has a number of methods of doing this, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages for different kinds of image.

**Exporting the finished product**
Inkscape imports in a wide range of formats - I won't go through all of them, but these are the basics
*The default kind is an Inkscape SVG (.svg) file - these only open in Inkscape and other specialist Illustrator programs.
*You can export your files as .pngs - this is what I usually do (at the required size)
*If you want to preserve the vector encoding of your image, you will have to export it in a format that does so - one is .pdf, but I'm sure there are more.

**Your future with Inkscape**
This has been super basic, the best way to learn is to try and make a poster or figure. If you have any problems or specific questions feel free to email me on r.dearden14@imperial.ac.uk
