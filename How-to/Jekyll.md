**JEKYLL REMINDER SHEET**

I run my [website](https://rpdearden.github.io/) using Jekyll and Github pages.

This is currently really a reminder to myself about how it works - I may expand it later.

**Jekyll command line**

* Navigate to correct directory in Terminal
* To serve (when testing locally) - this will update as you make changes
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
* To build - this is a one-off build
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

* Then sync any changes with Github

**Embedded pdfs**

* Worked this out using method shown [here](http://vinhqdang.github.io/tutorial/2016/10/26/publishing-pdf-with-jekyll)
* CV is stored in googledrive folder "Jekyll pdfs".  To update, just re-load pdf and build site again

**Preparing images**

* All the following are done in GIMP
* Flatten image: Image > Flatten
* Scale down
* Export as jpeg
