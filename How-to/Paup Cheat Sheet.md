**PAUP CHEAT SHEET**

**A selection of simple paup commands with reminders as to what they do**
***

**Set directory**
```
CD /Users/Directory/etc;
```
**Set up log**
```
Log File=Filename.log;
```
**Read in Matrix**
```
Execute Filename.nex;
```
**Read in monophyly constraint from .tre file**
```
Loadconstr File=Filename.tre;
```
**Read in backbone constraint from .tre file**
```
Loadconstr File=Filename.tre Asbackbone = yes;
```
**Show active constraints**
```
Showconstr
```
**set outgroup**
```
Outgroup taxon;
```
**root on outgroup**
```
set root = outgroup;
```
**Delete taxa**
```
Delete [List taxa with commas]
```
**Run heuristic search with constraints in place (and Giles et al. protocol, 1000 replicates and holding 5 trees at each step)**
```
hsearch Swap=TBR addseq=random Enforce=yes NReps=1000 Hold=5;
```
**Run heuristic search with constraints in place (and Giles et al. protocol, 1000 replicates and holding 5 trees at each step)**
```
hsearch Swap=TBR addseq=random Enforce=no NReps=1000 Hold=5;
```
**NCHUCK method (eg. in Davis 2012)**
**First ran a heuristic search for 25 random sequence additions to estimate shortest tree length (TS)**
```
hsearch swap=tbr NReps=25 Hold=1
```
**Use TS +1 for chuckscore in next step and hold no more than 500 trees on each replicate  greater than or equal to TS**
```
hsearch swap=tbr NReps=10000 Chuckscore=TS+1 Nchuck=500
```
**Save trees (all)**
```
SaveTrees File=Filename.tre
```
**Generate consensuses and save to file**
```
ConTree All / Strict=yes Majrule=yes TreeFile=Filename.tre;
```
**Stop log**
```
Log Stop=yes;
```
**Read in tree**
```
Gettrees file=filename;
```
**Agreement subtree**
```
Agree [trees];
```
**Apomorphy list**
```
describe 1 /Apolist opt=deltran
```
**Bootstrapping**
```
bootstrap nreps=100 search=heuristic /addseq=random;
```
**save trees with bootstrap values - ie. resample with replacement**
```
savetrees from=1 to=1 savebootp=nodelabels file=filename.tre;
```
**Bremer support values (indirect) - how many additional steps does it take for the node to break down?**
* Run search
* Run search again, retaining all trees of MPT+5 steps
```
	. hsearch keep="MPT+5";
```
* make a strict consensus
* All nodes that remain have Bremer score of 5 (highest)
* Filter through going down - as nodes are lost they are their Bremer decay indices
```
	filter maxscore=MPT+4;
```

**Workflow for filtering trees by a backbone filter tree**
```
Loadconstr File=Filename Asbackbone=yes;
Showconstr
filter constraint=filter;
```
