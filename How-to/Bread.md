**White loaf**
[Quantities from [The Fabulous Baker Brothers](https://www.hobbshousebakery.co.uk/blogs/recipes/140085191-white-bread-recipe)]
* Makes a normal sized loaf - or use it for breadrolls
* 560g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp oil, 2 tsp yeast, 2 tsp sugar, 300ml warm water
* Mix flour salt and oil, put yeast and sugar in water and mix.  Once frothy add into bowl with flour and knead on floured surface vigorously.  Cover in oiled clingfilm and leave to prove until doubled, beat down and let rise on tray until doubled again.  Then cook in oven for 20-40 mins, until underside is hollow.
* Tip: You're always better off with too wet than too dry dough - the latter is far easier to rectify by adding flour.
* Tip: I've found tearing the dough while kneading helps

**Ciabatta**
[From [Paul Hollywood](http://paulhollywood.com/recipes/ciabatta/)]
* Makes four rolls
* 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp oil, 2 tsp yeast, 2 tsp sugar, 400ml warm water, (optional) semolina for dusting
* Make as with normal bread, but makes extremely wet dough - this is what gives the bread its cancellous structure.  
* Although PH recommends using a dough hook, I've found this works with your hands

**Focaccia**
[Quantities from [Paul Hollywood](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/focaccia_08389)]
* 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp oil, 2 tsp yeast, 2 tsp sugar, 300ml warm water
* Make dough as with white but knead in oil.  On rising (second, not proving) put on tray, drizzle in oil and poke dimples into surface.
* Top this however you like.  I usually heat some oil with rosemary and garlic, leave it to infuse, then put it on before cooking with caramelised onions.

**Pizza**
* Makes about one big, rectangular pizza tray worth
* This is just the bread recipe, but halved and with a bit less flour
* 200g strong white flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp oil, 1 tsp yeast, 1 tsp sugar, 150ml warm water

**Cornbread**
[From Anna's friend]

* 1 c polenta, 1 c flour, 2-4 Tbsp sugar or more if you like it sweet, 1 Tbsp baking powder, ½ tsp salt, 1 ¼ c milk or however more makes it soupy, 1 egg, ¼ c butter melted
* Butter the pan (about an 8” pan) .  Mix the dry stuff, then the wet stuff, then all together.  Cook at 350 (?) 35 minutes or so til it’s pretty golden on top
* I find that using baking sheet gives the crust a weird texture, so I'd butter the pan as the recipe suggests instead
