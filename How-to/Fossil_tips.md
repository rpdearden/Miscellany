**Mounting a scale on a stub for scanning**

* I did this with nail polish - make a mound, let every layer dry thoroughly, and then afterwards soak in acetone to get scale off.
* However I did have a problem with subsidence in the nail polish mound - this may have been due to air bubbles or not letting lower layers dry sufficiently?
* Other suggestions that have worked are double sided tape, blu tac (perch the scale on a peak), and beeswax.

**Mounting a scale for SEM scanning**

* Ivan Sansom suggests doing this with PVA glue - get a small amount in a wash on the scale (with an old brush) and coat the surface of the mount.
* Get a very small amount more (too much might drown the sample) and attach the scale to the mount
* This dissolves in water
