**Geometric Morphometrics**
This is an introduction to Geometric Morphometrics (GMM)

**Overview**
Shape analysis seeks to compare differences in shape between objects. 
Shape is defined as the geometric information that is left when differences in position, size, and orientation are removed.
This means that these factors must be removed to analyse shape using landmarks, which can be defined with coordinates.
This can be done by calculating the centroid of each set of landmarks, i.e. the mean set of coordinates.
Centroid size is then calculated by the square root of the sum of squared distances from landmarks to centroid.
Centroid size is a measurement of size, which is mathematically independent of shape
A configuration of landmarks must be analysed as a whole.

**Landmarks**
Landmarks are anatomical loci, common to all studied specimens, which can be used to compare shape.
They must correspond, but not necessarily in terms of biological homology - mechanical correspondence would also work.
Mathematically the homology between landmarks can be thought of as a deformation (e.g. deform a grid).
Limitations limit what can be analysed with morphometrics, such as radical changes in topology, or the disappearance of landmarks in some specimens.
Adequate coverage is important - this can be addressed by relaxing rule of homology, but caution important!
Other important points of consideration are the repeatability of landmarks and their coplanarity.
Bookstein (1991) defines three types of landmark based on their definability with respect to the structure.
See GMfB for worked examples of landmarking and picture-taking advice.

This is a simple method for obtaining shape variables also called "two-point registration".
